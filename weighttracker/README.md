1. We created an app that allows you to log your weight loss/gain progress and I am currently on a weight loss journey so it inspired me.
2. Our app's purpose is to keep track of a person's weight and have them write ideas and thoughts on how to achieve their goals. 
3. Jacob Campbell and Parth Parikh
4. All our code has been purely written by and and from our knowledge from the class. 
5. We have a functioning database and a client that can interact with the database. 
6. We did not make components using classes as you will see in our project. we used the tools given by react and implemented our own components. 
7. The user can click new entry, edit that entry, and delete entries with the client and have those changes appear in the database.
8. We used state to accomplish our goals with manipulating the database, per your videos.
9. Our client adheres to the design principles and works with different sized screens.
10. we have created our own fetch call for fro numerous actions such as saving, adding, deleting, adn loading and entry. 
11. We have a progress bar at the top of the screen when these loading events happen.
12. As you will see in our console, we have 0 errors and warnings. 
13. We have our front end client on github and it is shared with Dr. Johnson.
14. Our front-end is available through this url: https://project2.basementjj.me:8442. Users will also be redirected to port 443 when they visis port 80, as seen in our certificate. 
15. We have a database that stores the data long term, I am not sure when it will go away actually, does it ever? 
16. The database is only accessible from our client and we have a ufw to block all other ports.
17. Our web servce does send and receive complex JSON data as seen in our actions.js.
18. Our endpoints are post, patch, and delete for our web service.
19. We have added cors to our project.
20. On our droplet, we have created a process manager, like pm2, that our web service stays runnning. 
21. Our project is encased in an nginx server.
